Mobile Service Tower Imploded - Natural sound only - no audio. The mobile
service tower, or gantry, at Space Launch Complex 40, was imploded
on Sunday, April 27, 2008. This mammoth structure, with its cavernous
clean room, was used for the final spacecraft launch preparations for
NASA's Cassini spacecraft, currently orbiting Saturn. This historic
launch occurred on Oct. 15, 1997, aboard an Air Force Titan IV-Centaur
rocket. The existing facilities at the pad are being dismantled to make
room for construction of new launch pad access and servicing facilities
for the new Falcon rockets to be launched by SpaceX.
